# Style

- For every styling, use tailwind css.
- For tokens, use [tokens.css](mdc:app/tokens.css).
- If there is Appbar (time, wifi, battery, ..), Home Indicator and so on.. just ignore for now. We are building desktop web browser version first.

# Component

- Component should be created in components/
- For icon and svg, create component at components/icons.
- Try to reuse components from components/* as much as you can.
- If Component is created, add storybook files as well.
- The `Default` example of storybook should be named `Primary`
